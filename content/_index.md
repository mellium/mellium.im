This site is a collection links to Go libraries and support tools implementing
the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), sometimes known as Jabber
for historical reasons.

All of our software is built cooperatively in accordance with the [ICA's][ICA]
[_Statement on the Cooperative Identity_][statement].
If you'd like to join us in promoting the XMPP protocol in a friendly and
welcoming co-op, you can [contribute] code, documentation, [donate], help us
write bylaws, or use just about any other skill you might have!
The best way to get started is by joining our [chat room] and saying hi; we hope
to see you there!
