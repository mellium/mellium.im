Package **`compress`** implements XML level stream compression.

Be advised: stream compression has many of the same security considerations as
TLS compression (see [RFC 3749 ยง6]) and may be difficult to implement safely
without special expertise.

[RFC 3749 ยง6]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3749#section-6
